From friends I learned about . I got acquainted with the principles of the school and I was very interested. I appreciate that the school helps to broaden the horizons, but students should fill in the knowledge themselves. I think this is a great approach to learning, because everything comes with experience. According to my feelings, this is a comfortable training for me, since I am quite diligent and attentive. Also, helping other students helps me practice a lot.
