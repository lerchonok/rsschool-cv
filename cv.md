From friends I learned about . I got acquainted with the principles of the school and I was very interested. I appreciate that the school helps to broaden the horizons, but students should fill in the knowledge themselves. I think this is a great approach to learning, because everything comes with experience. According to my feelings, this is a comfortable training for me, since I am quite diligent and attentive. Also, helping other students helps me practice a lot.

Now I am studying at ITMO University in my second year and decided to add knowledge with the help of the school. I am working on improving my time management, so there will be no difficulties combining several trainings. I have experience working with programming languages such as: C, C++, C# and a little Java. The experience is only in the curriculum, because I have never worked at work. I'm going to join the working life soon.

Also, English is taught at the university according to the levels of students. Now I have graduated from level B2, now I have switched to C1. But I also try to gain experience of speech on my own. For example, reading books and watching movies in English.

*This code does not execute properly. Try to figure out why.*

'public class CustomMath {
    public static int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }
}'

*You have passed all of the tests! :)*
